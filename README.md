# Image-segmentation-using-Skimage
- Experimenting with various functionalities skimage provides to us.
- First task involves image segmentation using thresholding where we use hysteresis threshold to find the best parameter that can detect strawberries.
- Second task involves identifying a car's numberplate using skimage.
- Applied various image enhancement techniques like, smoothing, sharpening, labeling, etc.
